#Rules: There are 4 squares, and the player needs to repeat (by clicking) the same random sequence as the computer (each time you guess correct, a new square gets highlighted and you pass the level). If you guess wrong, everything is resetted.

The game is made with bootstrap and jquery. 

The index.js file consists the handling of clicks on the squares (checking if the clicks are correct and handling the exception of the start - where the game starts by pressing any key), the sequencing of the squares, restarting the game when the player is wrong, adding the sounds/animation to the squares.
